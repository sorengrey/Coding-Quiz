This application is a short quiz to test your basic JavaScript coding knowledge. There are five multiple-choice questions worth one point each. The user has 75 seconds to answer all of the questions, and if the timer runs out, the quiz is over. At the end, the user is able to enter their initials to the Highscores page, like one would in a game.
